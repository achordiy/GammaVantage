---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### **Steps to Set Up Locally**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NormVg/GammaVintage
   cd GammaVintage
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

---

## **Changing the API URL**

The application uses a proxy to connect to the backend API. Follow these steps to modify the API endpoint:

### **Development**

1. Open the `vite.config.js` file located in the project root.

2. Update the `proxy` configuration:

   ```javascript
   server: {
     proxy: {
       '/api': {
         target: 'http://15.207.89.208:9876/',
         changeOrigin: true,
         rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
       },
     },
   },
   ```

3. Replace `http://15.207.89.208:9876/` with the new API URL.

4. Save the file and restart the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Production**

For deployment (e.g., Vercel), update the `vercel.json` file:

1. Locate the `rewrites` section:

   ```json
   "rewrites": [
     {
       "source": "/api/:path*",
       "destination": "http://15.207.89.208:9876/:path*"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Replace `http://15.207.89.208:9876/` with the new API URL.

3. Redeploy the project:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## **Adding Blogs**

Adding blogs to GammaVantage is simple and straightforward.

1. **Edit the Blog Data**:  
   Navigate to the file `src/assets/data/Blogs.json`. Add a new entry in the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "unique-id",
     "title": "Blog Title",
     "description": "A brief summary of the blog.",
     "file": "filename.md"
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "article-3",
     "title": "NEW - Trading with Real-Time Data: Why It Matters",
     "description": "Learn the importance of real-time data in fast-moving markets and how it can enhance your trading strategy.",
     "file": "real-time-trading.md"
   }
   ```

2. **Add the Blog Content**:  
   Place the corresponding markdown file in the `public/markdown/` directory.

   Example:

   - If the `"file"` in `Blogs.json` is `real-time-trading.md`, ensure the file `real-time-trading.md` exists in `public/markdown/`.

3. **Verify**:  
   Save the changes, and restart the development server if needed:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Done**:  
   The blog will now appear on the platform dynamically.

---

1. **Edit the Sample Question Data**:  
   Navigate to the file `src/assets/data/SampleQuestionDB.json`. Add, edit, or remove questions as required in the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "id": unique-id,
     "question": "Your sample question"
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "id": 17,
     "question": "What are the top 5 performing sectors today?"
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure Unique IDs**:  
   Each entry must have a unique `id` to avoid conflicts.

3. **Save and Verify**:  
   Save the file, and restart the development server if necessary:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Done**:  
   The new or modified questions will now appear in the application.
